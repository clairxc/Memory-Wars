How good is your memory? 

Trust Your Memory Do You? is a game that requires observation, concentration, and a good memory to win.

The player will turn any two cards image side up.
- Match: a player makes a match if the two cards turned image side up are identical
- Miss: a player misses if the two cards turned over are not identical

The game continues until all cards have been matched.
