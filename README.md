How good is your memory? 

Trust Your Memory Do You? is a game that requires observation, concentration, and a good memory to win.

The player will turn any two cards image side up.
- Match: a player makes a match if the two cards turned image side up are identical
- Miss: a player misses if the two cards turned over are not identical

The game continues until all cards have been matched.


## Objective
Find the pairs of matching cards


## MVP
- [ ] Create a gameboard (8x4)
- [ ] Shuffle the cards (images should start face down)
- [ ] When player clicks on a card, card flips over to show image
- [ ] If two cards are a matching pair, cards stay facing up
- [ ] If two cards are not a matching pair, cards get flipped back face down
- [ ] Create a reset button


## Tech Being Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Use animation 
- [ ] Option to be single player or two player
- [ ] Create a separate start button (not necessary to start game)
- [ ] Create a timer

## Accomplished MVPs
- [x] Create a gameboard (8x4)
- [x] Shuffle the cards (images should start face down)
- [x] When player clicks on a card, card flips over to show image
- [x] If two cards are a matching pair, cards stay facing up
- [x] If two cards are not a matching pair, cards get flipped back face down
- [x] Create a reset button that reshuffles and flips cards back face down

## Actual Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap (icons)


## Accomplished Stretch Goals
Actually chose not to tackle most of the original stretch goals as it seemed to not suite the game.
Didn't realize how difficult a 32-card memory game would be-- takes QUITE a long time to match them all ðŸ˜“
Instead, tried to implement the below stretch goals:

- [ ] Use animation when shuffling the cards and when player doesn't make a match
    - partially accomplished-- used some animation, but wasn't able to implement the specific animation I wanted
- [x] Create a shuffle button (can also be used to "start" the game)
- [x] Utilize bootstrap somehow
    - used for icons 
- [x] Add background music
    - was originally going to embed it, but bad UX experience/practice, so created the option for the player to turn it on/off
- [ ] Make page responsive
    - partially accomplished-- wasn't able to get the divs to automatically push the columns down accordingly when      screen got smaller


## Extras
- [x] Added lightsaber favicon to title (shoutout to Jason!)
- [x] Added gif background

## Things I Learned
I learned that the small things can make a big difference. 
The tiniest little typo can break your code, while adding the smallest little detail can give your project that little spark.
